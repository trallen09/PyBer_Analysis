# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of Project
Overview of the analysis: The task was to visualize ride-sharing data by city type. Those city types are Urban, Suburban, and Rural. For each type of city, the goal was to show the total weekly fares for each city type for 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-29.

## Results
Results: There aren't as many rides or drivers but the Rural drivers make the most money per ride and per driver. Second, would be the suburban drivers.


- Rural:
  - Total rides: 125
  - total drivers: 78 
  - total fares: $4,327.93
  - average fare per ride: $34.62
  - average fare per driver: $55.49
- Suburban:
  - total rides: 625
  - total drivers: 490
  - total fares: $19,356.33
  - average fare per ride: $30.97
  - average fare per driver: $39.50
- Urban:
  - Total rides: 1625
  - total drivers: 2405 
  - total fares: $39,854.38
  - average fare per ride: $24.53
  - average fare per driver: $16.57

### Summary
Recommendation:
  - Look into increasing Urban driver's pay based on the low incentive relative to the rest of the city types
  - Gather more data to include wait times
  - Look into moving Urban drivers to Suburban and Rural areas
  
Based on the analysis, I think we should look into incitivizing current Urban drivers or look into moving Urban drivers into more lucrative city types. Gathering more data to include wait times and Pyber's ability to service it's customers would be helpful.
